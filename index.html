                    <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
                        which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot,
                        which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed
                        in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be
                        incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
                        greater artist than now.

                        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the
                        upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the
                        inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie
                        close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the
                        little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the
                        insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and
                        the breath.</p>
